We are delighted to present version v1.24.0-rc.1 of Contour, our layer 7 HTTP reverse proxy for Kubernetes clusters.

A big thank you to everyone who contributed to the release.

**Please note that this is pre-release software**, and as such we do not recommend installing it in production environments.
Feedback and bug reports are welcome!

# Minor Changes

## Add optional health check port for HTTP health check and TCP health check

HTTPProxy.Route.Service and HTTPProxy.TCPProxy.Service now has an optional `HealthPort` field which specifies a health check port that is different from the routing port. If not specified, the service `Port` field is used for healthchecking.

(#4761, @yangyy93)

## Secrets not relevant to Contour no longer validated

Contour no longer validates Secrets that are not used by an Ingress, HTTPProxy, Gateway, or Contour global config.
Validation is now performed as needed when a Secret is referenced.
This change also replaces misleading "Secret not found" error conditions with more specific errors when a Secret referenced by one of the above objects does exist, but is not valid.

(#4788, @skriss)

## Optional Client Certificate Validation

By default, when client certificate validation is configured, client certificates are required.
However, some applications might support different authentication schemes.
You can now set the `httpproxy.spec.virtualhost.tls.clientValidation.optionalClientCertificate` field to `true`. A client certificate will be requested, but the connection is allowed to continue if the client does not provide one.
If a client certificate is sent, it will be verified according to the other properties, which includes disabling validations if `httpproxy.spec.virtualhost.tls.clientValidation.skipClientCertValidation` is set.

(#4796, @gautierdelorme)

## Client Certificate Details Forwarding

HTTPProxy now supports passing certificate data through the `x-forwarded-client-cert` header to let applications use details from client certificates (e.g. Subject, SAN...).
Since the certificate (or the certificate chain) could exceed the web server header size limit, you have the ability to select what specific part of the certificate to expose in the header through the `httpproxy.spec.virtualhost.tls.clientValidation.forwardClientCertificate` field.
Read more about the supported values in the [Envoy documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#x-forwarded-client-cert).

## Bump Envoy to v1.24.1

Bumps Envoy to security patch version 1.24.1.
See Envoy release notes [here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.24.1/version_history/v1.24/v1.24.1).

(#4900, @sunjayBhatia)

## Enable configuring Server header transformation 

Envoy's treatment of the Server header on responses can now be configured in the Contour config file or ContourConfiguration CRD.
When configured as `overwrite`, Envoy overwrites any Server header with "envoy".
When configured as `append_if_absent`, ‚Å£if a Server header is present, Envoy will pass it through, otherwise, it will set it to "envoy".
When configured as `pass_through`, Envoy passes through the value of the Server header and does not append a header if none is present.

(#4906, @Vishal-Chdhry)

Added support for `ALL` DNS lookup family. If `ALL` is specified, the DNS resolver will perform a lookup for both IPv4 and IPv6 families, and return all resolved addresses. When this is used, Happy Eyeballs will be enabled for upstream connections.

(#4909, @Vishal-Chdhry)

## Fix handling of duplicate HTTPProxy Include Conditions

Duplicate include conditions are now correctly identified and HTTPProxies are marked with the condition `IncludeError` and reason `DuplicateMatchConditions`.
Previously the HTTPProxy processor was only comparing adjacent includes and comparing conditions element by element rather than as a whole, ANDed together.

In addition, the previous behavior when duplicate Include Conditions were identified was to throw out all routes, including valid ones, on the offending HTTPProxy.
Any referenced child HTTPProxies were marked as `Orphaned` as a result, even if they were included correctly.
With this change, all valid Includes and Route rules are processed and programmed in the data plane, which is a difference in behavior from previous releases.
An Include is deemed to be a duplicate if it has the exact same match Conditions as an Include that precedes it in the list.
Only child HTTPProxies that are referenced by a duplicate Include and not in any other valid Include are marked as `Orphaned`

(#4931, @sunjayBhatia)

## Contour supports Gateway API release v0.6.0

See [the Gateway API release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for more detail on the API changes.
This version of the API includes a few changes relevant to Contour users:
- The ReferenceGrant resource has been graduated to the v1beta1 API and ReferencePolicy removed from the API
- v1alpha2 versions of GatewayClass, Gateway, and HTTPRoute are deprecated
- There have been significant changes to status conditions on various resources for consistency:
  - Accepted and Programmed conditions have been added to Gateway and Gateway Listener
  - The Ready condition has been moved to "extended" conformance, at this moment Contour does not program this condition
  - The Scheduled condition has been deprecated on Gateway

(#4944, @sunjayBhatia)

## shutdown-manager sidecar container liveness probe removed

The liveness probe has been removed from the Envoy pods' shutdown-manager sidecar container.
This change is to mitigate a problem where when the liveness probe fails, the shutdown-manager container is restarted by itself.
This ultimately has the unintended effect of causing the envoy container to be stuck indefinitely in a "DRAINING" state and not serving traffic.
    
Overall, not having the liveness probe on the shutdown-manager container is less bad because envoy pods are less likely to get stuck in "DRAINING" indefinitely. 
In the worst case, during termination of an Envoy pod (due to upgrade, scaling, etc.), shutdown-manager is truly unresponsive, in which case the envoy container will simply terminate without first draining active connections.
If appropriate (i.e. during an upgrade), a new Envoy pod will then be created and re-added to the set of ready Envoys to load balance traffic to.

(#4967, @skriss)

## Update Envoy to v1.25.0

Bumps Envoy to version 1.25.0.
See Envoy release notes [here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.25.0/version_history/v1.25/v1.25.0).

# Deprecation and Removal Notices


# ContourDeployment.Spec.Contour.Replicas and ContourDeployment.Spec.Envoy.Replicas are deprecated

- `ContourDeployment.Spec.Contour.Replicas` is deprecated and has been replaced by `ContourDeployment.Spec.Contour.Deployment.Replicas`. Users should switch to using the new field. The deprecated field will be removed in a future release. See #4713 for additional details.

- `ContourDeployment.Spec.Envoy.Replicas` is deprecated and has been replaced by `ContourDeployment.Spec.Envoy.Deployment.Replicas`. Users should switch to using the new field. The deprecated field will be removed in a future release. See #4713 for additional details.

(#4713, @izturn)

## Gateway API: ReferencePolicy no longer supported (use ReferenceGrant instead)

In Gateway API, ReferencePolicy's rename to ReferenceGrant has been fully completed.
Contour now only supports ReferenceGrant, and does not support ReferencePolicy resources in any way.

(#4830, @skriss)


# Installing and Upgrading

The simplest way to install v1.24.0-rc.1 is to apply one of the example configurations:

With Gateway API:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcontour/contour/v1.24.0-rc.1/examples/render/contour-gateway.yaml
```

Without Gateway API:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcontour/contour/v1.24.0-rc.1/examples/render/contour.yaml
```


# Compatible Kubernetes Versions
